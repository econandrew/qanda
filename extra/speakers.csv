Although all bishops are deemed to be on equal footing, the Metropolitan See of Brisbane makes Archbishop Coleridge the head of the province of Queensland (which also comprises the suffragan dioceses of Toowoomba, Rockhampton, Townsville and Cairns).In reflecting upon his four decades as a priest and a Bishop, Archbishop Coleridge has noted that almost nothing had turned out as he expected, but invariably events had turned out better than they would have had he planned them himself."1586,ARCHIE ROACH,0,MUSICIAN,,29/10/2012,"Archie Roach is a singer and songwriter of remarkable strengths and insights. A storyteller in the tradition of his ancestors, Archie relays and retells intimate real life stories as well as traditional stories of the Dreaming. Archie was born at Framlingham Aboriginal mission, located near Warrnambool in south western Victoria. At any early age, Archie was taken from his family, part of the notorious stolen generation and spent quite some time in institutions before being fostered by a non-Indigenous family in Melbourne.He recorded his first record, , in 1990 with Paul Kelly as producer. The album contained , a song that dealt with Archie's personal experience. The album won two Aria Awards and a Human Rights Award - the first time a Human Rights award has been awarded to a songwriter. It was also in the 's Top 50 albums for 1992 and achieved gold status in Australia.Over the past few decades Archie has consistently and extensively toured Australia including participating in regional Indigenous cultural festivals in every state. As with many Indigenous artists, Archie has contributed to many benefit concerts and to raising awareness about issues of equality and justice that affect the whole community. Archie has toured with Paul Kelly, Weddings Parties Anything, Crowded House and international artists Bob Dylan, Billy Bragg, Tracy Chapman, Joan Armatrading, Suzanne Vega and Patti Smith.Archies great love Ruby Hunter died too young in early 2010. In October of that year Archie suffered a stroke while holding music classes with children at remote Turkey Creek in the Kimberley. He was unable to walk and his whole right side was buggered including his guitar strumming hand. Through rehabilitation and practice, he was able to walk and play the guitar once again. Then doctors discovered Archie had the very early stages of lung cancer. He opted for surgery and had half a lung removed.His new album,  is a triumphant and also courageous return. This is a man who lost everything then lost some more but he has been bold enough to come back to the stage and the spotlight and tell us what he has learned."160,BARNABY JOYCE,0,POLITICIAN,NATIONAL,30/04/2009,"In mid-2005 Barnaby Joyce took his seat in the Senate chamber as a National Party representative from Queensland.

His fortune is estimated at $US72 billion.In 1975, Bill left Harvard University before graduating to focus on Microsoft, the company he founded with his childhood friend Paul Allen. As chief software architect and chairman, Bill led the company to become the worldwide leader in business and personal software, services and solutions. On doing so he was at the forefront of a communications and technological revolution that transformed the world in which we live. In 2008 he stepped down as executive chairman of the company, but remained in an advisory role.Bill and his wife Melinda are world leaders in the field of philanthropy. Bill began his major philanthropic efforts in 1994, creating the William H. Gates Foundation which focused on global health. Three years later, he and Melinda created the Gates Library Foundation, which worked to bring public access computers with Internet connections to libraries in the United States. Its name changed to the Gates Learning Foundation in 1999 to reflect its focus on ensuring that low-income minority students were prepared for college and had the means to attend. In 2000, to increase efficiency and communication, the two groups merged into the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Bill and Melinda have donated $US28 billion of their personal fortune to the foundation, which they operate with fellow billionaire Warren Buffet (currently third on the Bloomberg list with nearly $US 60 billion).

After attending boarding school in Sydney he returned to the family property and became a successful large-scale farmer. His political career began on the Junee Shire Council in 1984. He joined the Liberals in 1985 and was made president of the NSW Division in 1993. He entered the Senate in 1996.Though never a minister, Bill was regarded by John Howard as a key member of the coalition government. As Parliamentary Secretary to Cabinet he wielded considerable influence and kept his Prime Minister aware of political developments in the broad electorate and non-metropolitan parts of the country.He has a long history of committee service, is active on many parliamentary bodies concerned with regional affairs and is regarded as an expert on the key issue of water and its availability to farmers."1799,BILL MCKIBBEN,0,AUTHOR,,03/06/2013,"Bill McKibben is the author of a dozen books about the environment, beginning with  in 1989, which is regarded as the first book for a general audience on climate change.  called him 'the planet's best green journalist' and the  said in 2010 that he was 'probably the country's most important environmentalist.'Bill grew up in suburban Lexington, Massachusetts. He was president of the  newspaper in college. Immediately after college he joined the  magazine as a staff writer, and wrote much of the ""Talk of the Town"" column from 1982 to early 1987. He quit the magazine when its long-time editor William Shawn was forced out of his job, and soon moved to the Adirondack Mountains of upstate New York.His next book, , was published in 1992. It is an account of an experiment: Bill collected everything that came across the 100 channels of cable TV on the Fairfax, Virginia system (at the time among the nation's largest) for a single day. He spent a year watching the 2400 hours of videotape, and then compared it to a day spent on the mountaintop near his home. In March 2007, Bill published Deep Economy: the Wealth of Communities and the Durable Future. It addresses what the author sees as shortcomings of the growth economy and envisions a transition to more local-scale enterprise.Bill is a frequent contributor to various magazines including , and . He is also a board member and contributor to .Bill currently resides with his wife, writer Sue Halpern, and his daughter, Sophie, who was born in 1993, in Ripton, Vermont."39,BILL SHORTEN,0,POLITICIAN,LABOR,26/02/2009,"Before entering Parliament Bill Shorten was one of Australias best-known trade union leaders.

They released one EP on Chiswick Records before Billy joined the British Army in 1981, training to become a tank driver in the Royal Armoured Corps. Things didnt work out and in early 1982 he found himself back on the streets of Barking, still writing songs.Following a year of relentless gigging, his first album,  came out in 1983. He famously scored his first radio play by delivering a mushroom biryani to a hungry John Peel at the BBC. Billy was politicised by Rock Against Racism in the late 1970s and saw his music as a way of offering an alternative version of political events. He marshalled his songs in opposition to Margaret Thatcher, supporting the miners when they went on strike in 1984 and subsequently founding Red Wedge, a collective of left wing musicians who campaigned for the defeat of Thatcher at the 1987 election.Although often defined by his political songs, Billy is also a writer of great love songs. He said  I write about the things that make me angry: sometimes its the government, sometimes its the girl .

She continues to support communities, to work with the bereaved community, and remains a member of the Victorian Bushfire Appeal Fund panel.Christines priority is to help communities recover and rebuild in a way that is safe, timely, efficient, and respectful of each communitys different needs.Prior to joining the Authority, Christine was the 19th Chief Commissioner of Victoria Police, the first woman to become a police commissioner in Australia. She led 14,000 staff, operating across more than 500 locations and oversaw an annual budget of $1.7 billion.Christine was a police officer for over thirty years and prior to becoming Chief Commissioner of Victoria Police she had an extensive career in the New South Wales Police Force, attaining the rank of Assistant Commissioner.Christines's performance as Chief Commissioner, in a sometimes controversial career where she challenged the institution to improve, is probably best assessed by a credible and academically rigorous study produced on behalf of the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) by the Australian Productivity Commission.In 2011, her biography  was published.

He is also one of the most acerbic, renowned for his withering scorn. He once described Princess Diana as 'a simpering Bambi narcissist, and Mother Teresa as a thieving, fanatical Albanian dwarf.'An author, journalist, literary critic and political observer, Christopher is much sought-after as a lecturer and television commentator in the United States, where he now lives, and his native United Kingdom. Once a Trotskyist, his dissatisfaction with the Left began in 1989 when a fatwa  an Islamic death sentence - was placed on his friend, author Salman Rushdie, by the Ayatollah Khomeini. The terror attacks of September 11, 2001 strengthened his opposition to Islamofascism and he became a vocal supporter of the Iraq war and the overthrow of Saddam Hussein.But Christopher rejects labels such us neoconservative (""Im not any kind of conservative"") and is usually described as a radical who opposes any kind of totalitarianism and stands for individual liberty.As an author, editor and journalist Christophers output is prodigious. His most recent book, 2007s , is a fierce denunciation of organised religion: 'violent, irrational, intolerant, allied to racism, tribalism, invested in ignorance and hostile to free inquiry, contemptuous of women and coercive toward children.'Christopher was born in Portsmouth, England in 1949 and attended Oxford University.

The unprecedented dismissal came after Peter was accused of fostering unorthodox practices, changing words in liturgies , supporting women preachers, allowing a gay and lesbian choir to rehearse on the church grounds and using lay people in services.The dismissal of Father Kennedy, a priest for 50 years, is believed to be the first of its kind within Australia's Catholic Church.

Hundreds more have turned out to concerts and rallies in his support. Father Kennedy has not flouted the Archbishop's ""decree of removal"" by giving communion during mass.  Instead, he has been giving readings as a church community member .  He has predicted that the events at his church may prompt other parishes to throw off the shackles of conservative Catholicism"".Peter was born in Bowen in northern Queensland in  1937. His father was a State School Teacher and the family travelled all over Queensland teaching in one teacher schools. Peter was educated at Ipswich Christian Brothers and graduated at Nudgee College High School in 1956.  After a failed attempt at accountancy (he was sacked after 3 months) he decided  to enter  the seminary and has been in parish work ever since.

Ruxton usually had little time for feminists and to many of Germaines generation the RSL was the embodiment of conservative repression.

Her mother, Norma Chevathun, was a prominent indigenous leader in the 1980s and 90s and one of the original Wik native title claimants.Ginas parents instilled in her the importance of both a strong sense of her identity as an Aboriginal person and the need to succeed in mainstream society.  As a result, Gina moves easily between two very different worlds.Gina is managing director of Wik Projects Ltd, an organisation set up by Wik and Wik Waya traditional owners to articulate their aspirations, represent their interests and pursue sustainable economic development opportunities on their country  opportunities which provide better socio-economic outcomes for Aboriginal people and reflect cultural and environmental values important to traditional owners.Wik Projects currently supports two local indigenous businesses that operate for the benefit of the communities of the western Cape, Aurukun Wetland Charters (an eco-tourism businesses operating on the Aurukun wetlands) and Aurukun Earthmoving (which provides contract earthmoving mainly to Rio Tintos bauxite mine and to Queenslands Main Roads department). Wik Projects is also developing a proposal to harvest timber from the bauxite mining lease areas north of Aurukun  reducing carbon emissions by using a resource which would otherwise be bulldozed and burnt, and enabling traditional owners to be actively engaged in the rehabilitation of their country after mining is finished.Gina believes that everyone should have the opportunity to realise their aspirations and that this principle should apply as much to Aboriginal people as anyone else.  For decades, the lives of Aboriginal people in Aurukun were controlled first by missionaries and then by government.  For Gina, building an economic base will only happen if Aboriginal people and their organisations are empowered and supported, at the local level, to build it."1361,GLENN CARLE,0,,,21/05/2012,"Glenn Carle is a CIA interrogator turned writer.

Historians such as Geoffrey Blainey and Keith Windschuttle have labelled Henrys approach as a black armband view of Australian history.Henrys most recent book, co-authored with Marilyn Lake, is similarly contentious.  documents the authors concerns that in recent years unprecedented government intervention has seen the over-promotion of Anzac Day and the marginalising of other aspects of Australian history.Henry attended state schools as a boy in Hobart, and after obtaining his degree at the University of Tasmania, he taught in secondary schools in Australia and England, returning to Australia in 1964.While teaching at James Cook University in Townsville in the 1970s Henry formed a strong friendship with Murray Islander, Eddie Mabo. Henry assisted Eddie Mabo to take his peoples land claims to the High Court, where consequently the doctrine of terra nullius was overturned and the concept of Native Title was established in Australian law.Henry gained his doctorate in history from James Cook University, and was later Associate Professor of History and Politics at the University from 1982 until 1998. He then took up an Australian Research Council post at the University of Tasmania in Launceston, and subsequently a post at Riawunna, the Centre for Aboriginal Education of the University of Tasmania.Henry now lives in Tasmania with his wife, the former Queensland Senator Margaret Reynolds.

He worked on the staff of Liberal Treasurers Phillip Lynch and John Howard and then became a director of Macquarie Bank until entering Parliament as the member for Wentworth, in Sydneys east, in 1987. He became shadow finance minister in 1988 and shadow treasurer the following year. After the coalition lost the 1990 election he was elected Liberal leader, having been in Parliament just three years.John came to the job with strong convictions about economic policy, believing the Liberals had been inconsistent and unconvincing in their approach. While he was praised as a leader for taking the political fight up to Bob Hawke and Keating, he was criticised for being too centred on the economy. In 1991, with Australia in recession and the Labor government losing popularity, he launched the Fightback! package  a comprehensive blueprint, including a GST, designed to revive the Australian economy. It was initially popular, but by the time of the 1993 election Keating was able to raise enough doubt in the minds of voters that Labor was returned for a fifth term. John remained as leader but lost a ballot in 1994 after a concerted destabilisation campaign, and left Parliament the following year.Since then he has worked widely as an investment banker and company director, and chairs several boards. He is a frequent commentator on politics and has recently been highly critical of his one-time colleague Peter Costello."123,JOHN HEWSON,0,,,28/05/2012,"Dr John Hewson came to national prominence as Leader of the Liberal Party in the early 90s, and is renowned for losing the so-called unloseable election to Paul Keating in 1993.Born in Sydney in 1947, John was educated at Kogarah High School and the University of Sydney where he graduated in economics. He worked on the staff of Liberal Treasurers Phillip Lynch and John Howard and then became a director of Macquarie Bank until entering Parliament as the member for Wentworth, in Sydneys east, in 1987. He became shadow finance minister in 1988 and shadow treasurer the following year. After the coalition lost the 1990 election he was elected Liberal leader, having been in Parliament just three years.John came to the job with strong convictions about economic policy, believing the Liberals had been inconsistent and unconvincing in their approach. While he was praised as a leader for taking the political fight up to Bob Hawke and Keating, he was criticised for being too centred on the economy. In 1991, with Australia in recession and the Labor government losing popularity, he launched the Fightback! package  a comprehensive blueprint, including a GST, designed to revive the Australian economy. It was initially popular, but by the time of the 1993 election Keating was able to raise enough doubt in the minds of voters that Labor was returned for a fifth term. John remained as leader but lost a ballot in 1994 after a concerted destabilisation campaign, and left Parliament the following year.Since then he has worked widely as an investment banker and company director, and chairs several boards."765,JOHN HOWARD,0,,,25/10/2010,"John Howard has been one of Australias most influential conservative politicians and ranks with the most dominant national figures in the post-war era. He is Australias second-longest serving Prime Minister, having served in the office from March 1996 to December 2007  an 11-year stretch bettered only by the cumulative 18 years achieved by his political hero, Sir Robert Menzies.John was born in 1938 and grew up in the Sydney suburb of Earlwood. He became politically active in the Liberal Party as a teenager, becoming a committed party operator and campaigner and, in 1967, a (failed) State candidate. He entered Federal Parliament for the Sydney seat of Bennelong in 1974, and was appointed Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs after the coalition, led by Malcolm Fraser, beat the Whitlam Labor government in the Dismissal election of 1975.In 1977 he was made Treasurer at the extremely young age of 38. He was an advocate of free-market economics and championed a range of reforms and policies which were frequently resisted by the Fraser cabinet. After Bob Hawke led Labor back to government in 1983 John was involved in a long-running leadership stoush with the more experienced Andrew Peacock. He defeated Peacock in a 1985 ballot and was defeated himself by Peacock in 1989 having lost the 1987 election.At a press conference on the night of his defeat he was asked whether he would consider the leadership again, and suggested that would be like Lazarus with a triple by-pass. Hence the title of his memoirs, . Many observers thought a come-back was beyond him as the Liberals experimented, and failed, with such leadership options as John Hewson and Alexander Downer. But in January 1995, with the party in a poor state and thought to be facing defeat, he took over from Downer and set about restoring the Liberal brand as Labor, under Paul Keating, lost its way. The election in 1996 was a landslide victory for the coalition.In government the Howard years had many key points, including the severe early spending cuts to restore the budget surplus, the GST, the Iraq war and the adoption of tough industrial relations legislation. The Howard government was widely seen as confrontational and ideological, and its relations with several communities  indigenous Australians, environmentalists, asylum seekers  were often strained. Just before the 2001 election the Government used the military to turn away the Tampa, a container vessel which had picked up a load of stricken asylum seekers, and set the tone for a debate over refugees that continues to this day.By 2007 the Howard government was being weakened on many fronts. It had refused to apologise to the stolen generation and to ratify the Kyoto protocol on global warming, both of which had great symbolic value. Treasurer Peter Costello was openly seeking the leadership and many Australians were unhappy with WorkChoices, the Governments revamped industrial relations legislation. Kevin Rudd led Labor to victory and former ABC presenter Maxine McKew defeated John in his own seat.Since then John has made only limited forays into public debate, though he was a prominent supporter of his protégé, Tony Abbott, in this years election. He has spent a lot of time on the international conservative speaking circuit and preparing his memoirs. John has been married to Janette since 1971 and they have three adult children, Melanie, Tim and Richard."688,JOHN KEANE,0,,,30/08/2010,"John Keane is Professor of Politics at the University of Sydney. He has just returned home after a long stay in Britain, where the  of London ranked him as one of Australias great intellectual exports and among the worlds leading political thinkers and writers.John has just published , the first full-scale history of democracy for over a century. Translations into Portuguese, Mandarin, Korean and Spanish are on their way. Shortlisted for the 2010 Non-Fiction Prime Ministers Literary Awards, the book springs quite a few surprises on readers and argues that democracies world-wide are sleepwalking their way into deep trouble. Born in Adelaide and proud of his South Australian roots, John was educated at the Universities of Adelaide, Toronto and Cambridge. Well before the Berlin wall came down, he first came to public prominence as a defender of civil society and the democratic opposition in central and eastern Europe. His political and scholarly writing during that period was often published under the pen name Erica Blair. In 1989 he founded the Centre for the Study of Democracy in London. Now back in Australia full-time, John regularly travels the world, including to Berlin, a city close to his heart and a place where he also holds an honorary chair at the WZB, Europes biggest and most respected social science think tank.Among his best-known books are  (first published in 1990 and since translated into more than 25 languages); the best-selling biography  (2009); a new interpretation of the advantages and limits of globalisation  (2003);  (2004) and  (to appear later this year).His current research and writing interests include China and the future of global institutions; the twenty-first century enemies of democracy; media decadence in the digital age; and the politics of religion and the future of secularism.

He went to many different primary schools, and from an early age enjoyed journeys into magical worlds that reading could provide. His teacher in Grade 4 and Grade 6 encouraged him to write, and at the age of nine he decided he wanted to become and author. For seven years he attended The Kings School Parramatta, a strict military school in Sydney. However, he soon decided that a career in law looked too boring, so he dropped out and drifted around for nearly 10 years, trying different jobs, and earning just enough money to support himself. When he was 28, he began a teaching course, which he loved from the start. Embarking on a teaching career, he also became more and more interested in writing, and in 1987 succeeded in getting his first book, , published. A string of huge hits followed, highlighted by the  series and . John has now sold more than 2.5 million books in Australia alone, but is an international best-seller, with many major awards to his credit. Johns interest in education has never waned. In 1998 he bought the Tye Estate, 850 acres of natural bush, on the northern edge of Melbourne, and later added the property next door. For eight years he ran enormously popular writers courses and camps at Tye, before his own school there, Candlebark, in 2006. Candlebark is a P-8 school, which has been described by John as somewhere between Steiner and The Simpsons. Its friendly lively and positive atmosphere has resulted in such early success that it has a four-year waiting list."811,JOHN PILGER,0,,,14/02/2011,"John Pilger, who grew up in Sydney, is known internationally as an unswerving opponent of tyranny and oppression and an articulate espouser of progressive causes.

His new film, , shown on TV and in cinemas in the UK in December, will soon be released in Australia. He is the author of numerous best-selling books, including  and . In 2003 he received the prestigious Sophie Prize for thirty years of exposing deception and improving human rights.

Johns works have been translated into 22 languages in 30 countries, and hes had a growing impact on political and economic thought in many of those countries.Born in Ottawa in 1947 John studied at McGill University in Montreal and at the University of London, where he earned his PhD in 1972. After working for Petro-Canada, he turned his attention to writing.His first works were novels, including  and .John is best known, however, for his philosophical essays. These began with a trilogy made up of the bestseller ; the polemic philosophical dictionary ; and the book that grew out of his presentation of the Massey Lectures, .In 2005 in The Collapse of Globalism and the Reinvention of the World, Saul warned that, like it or not, globalism was already collapsing and that if we did not act quickly we would be caught in a crisis and limited to emergency reactions. The Collapse of Globalism was re-issued in 2009 with an updated epilogue that addresses the current crisis.In his most recent national bestseller, , Saul argues that Canada's complex national identity is made up of the ""triangular reality"" of the three nations that compose it: Anglophones, Francophones, and the First Peoples. He emphasizes the willingness of these Canadian nations to compromise with one another, as opposed to resorting to open confrontations.A long-time champion of freedom of expression, in 2009 John was elected President of International PEN, the worldwide association of writers. He became interested in PEN after spending extended periods of time in North Africa and South-East Asia in the 1980s, where he witnessed fellow writers there suffering government suppression of freedom of expression.John is married to Adrienne Clarkson, a Canadian broadcaster, who was Governor General of Canada from 1999 to 2005. As Canada's vice-regal consort, John devoted much of his time to issues of freedom of expression, poverty, public education and bilingualism. His publishing of On Equilibrium subsequent to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks raised political controversy due to what some perceived as anti-American themes in its final chapter."294,JOHN ROSKAM,0,,,17/09/2009,"John Roskam has been the Executive Director of the free market think tank the Institute of Public Affairs since 2004.

This early education would prove useful as the future director began his career giving puppet shows for children's birthday parties. As a teenager, John began making 8-mm underground movies influenced by the likes of Jean-Luc Godard, Walt Disney, Andy Warhol, Russ Meyer, Ingmar Bergman, and Herschell Gordon Lewis.Using Baltimore, which he fondly dubbed the ""Hairdo Capitol of the World,"" as the setting for all his films, John assembled a cast of ensemble players, mostly native Baltimoreans and friends of long standing: Divine, David Lochary, Mary Vivian Pearce, Mink Stole and Edith Massey. John also established lasting relationships with key production people, such as production designer Vincent Peranio, costume designer Van Smith, and casting director Pat Moran, helping to give his films that trademark Waters ""look.""John made his first film, an 8-mm short,  in 1964, starring Mary Vivian Pearce. He followed with  in 1966, the first of his films to star Divine and Mink Stole. In 1967, he made his first 16-mm film with , the story of a deranged governess and her lover who kidnap fashion models and force them to model themselves to death. Mondo Trasho, John's first feature length film, was completed in 1969 despite the fact that the production ground to a halt when the director and two actors were arrested for ""participating in a misdemeanor, to wit: indecent exposure.""In 1970, he completed what he described as his first ""celluloid atrocity,"" . The film told the story of Lady Divine and her lover, Mr. David, proprietors of a freak show who lure unsuspecting suburbanites into their tents to witness ""The Cavalcade of Perversions."" In 1972 John created what would become the most ""notorious"" film in the American independent cinema of the 1970's, . The film turned John into a cult celebrity and went on to become a smash success at midnight screenings in the U.S. and all over the world. When the film was rereleased in 1997 John proudly boasted, ""it's hard to offend three generations, but it looks like I've succeeded.""John followed the success of  with three more pictures, spanning the remainder of the decade:  and , which was filmed in ""Odorama."" Ticket buyers were given scratch 'n' sniff cards that allowed the audience to smell along with the characters in their fragrant search for romantic happiness.In , John created ""an almost big-budget comedy extravaganza about star-struck teenage celebrities in 1962. The success of  brought John major Hollywood backing for his next feature, , a juvenile delinquent musical comedy satire, starring Johnny Depp. In 1994, John released , the well reviewed, socially un-redeeming comedy starring Kathleen Turner and Sam Waterston, which was the closing night attraction at that year's Cannes Film Festival.John then directed , a feel-good movie about lesbian strippers, pubic-hair harassment and amateur photography; , a comedy action-thriller about a young lunatic film director (Stephen Dorff) and his gang of film cultists who kidnap a real-life Hollywood movie goddess (Melanie Griffith) and force her to act in their own Super 8 underground movie; and , a film about head injury sufferers who, after their concussion, experience a carnal lust they cannot control. In addition to writing and directing feature films, John is the author of six books, he is a photographer and an actor.He is currently in Australia touring . Described as a vaudeville act,  celebrates the film career and obsessive tastes of the man William Burroughs once called The Pope of Trash. Focusing on Waters early artistic influences, his fascination with true crime, exploitation films, fashion lunacy, and the extremes of the contemporary art world, this joyously devious monologue elevates all that is trashy in life into a call to arms to filth followers everywhere."1151,JON RONSON,0,,,03/10/2011,"Jon Ronson is a writer and television presenter.

Born in Brisbane in 1955, she graduated from the University of Queensland with a pharmacy degree in 1976 and moved to Canberra shortly afterwards. By age 25 she owned the Red Hill pharmacy, trebling its turnover within three years and going on to buy three more pharmacies. In this period she was highly active within the Pharmacy Guild and representative bodies of the retail industry, and joined the ACT Liberals in 1991. She was elected to the Legislative Assembly in 1992, became Liberal leader the following year and won the election in 1995, becoming Chief Minister  a position she would retain for five years.Her time as Chief Minister was not without controversy, especially given Kates reformist inclinations and her desire to raise Canberras business and international tourism profile in the lead-up to the 2000 Olympics. She declared herself a pro-choice republican and strongly advocated drug law reform, including heroin trials and a relaxation of cannabis laws. She paid a political price for a number of expensive ventures designed to broaden Canberras image, and after winning the 1998 election became embroiled in a controversy over a costing blow-out for a stadium development. This culminated in her resignation in 2000.Since leaving politics she has held a number of positions, including NRMA board member, Executive Director of the National Association of Forest Industries and CEO of the Australian General Practice Network. She joined the AFGC in mid-2008.

The seat was formerly held by her old boss, Peter Costello, and she won it at a by-election in 2009 after he retired from politics.The by-election took place in trying circumstances. Kelly was forced to run her campaign while the Liberal Party in Canberra was embroiled in a bitter and public brawl over climate change policy and the leadership.

She graduated with Arts-Law honours and joined legal firm Freehills, where she practised in corporate law, before joining then-Treasurer Costello as a policy adviser. She subsequently became chief policy adviser, but when the coalition lost office in 2007 she became an executive at the National Australia Bank.As an active Liberal member Kelly has held many branch and electorate positions.

With an election due later in 2010, it is a perfect time for Kevin (who was Q&As first guest when the show began in 2008) to return to the program to kick off the 2010 season.A lot has happened in those two years. When Kevin came to office he moved quickly to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, formally apologise to indigenous Australians for the Stolen Generations, signal the end of combat operations by Australian troops in Iraq and appoint a woman as Australias next Governor-General. But throughout 2009 the overwhelming issue was the global financial crisis and Australias response to it. Also occupying the Governments mind was how to respond to global warming, the continuing war in Afghanistan, a new wave of boat people and problems in the relationship with economic giants China and India. While all this was happening the domestic political conflict continued unabated. Over its two years in office Labor has held a big lead over the coalition in the polls and late last year the Opposition elected its third leader since the 2007 election loss. Much of this success has been attributed to Kevins political acumen.Kevin was born in rural Queensland in 1957, the son of a share farmer and a nurse. When Kevin was 11 his father died in a road accident and the family endured several years of financial hardship. This experience heightened the sense of social justice that pushed Kevin  into joining the Labor Party at 15.A brilliant student, he was Dux of Nambour High and graduated from ANU with first class honours. He joined the Department of Foreign Affairs to work as a diplomat (he was First Secretary in the Beijing Embassy) and then became Chief of Staff to Queensland Premier Wayne Goss. He entered Parliament in 1998, having failed at his first try in 1996. He was appointed shadow minister for foreign affairs in 2001 and was elected ALP leader on December 4, 2006. Kevin and his wife Therese married in 1981.

The man who was a star player for the Richmond Tigers, took Essendon to four premierships in a 26-year coaching career and is a member of the Australian Football Hall of Fame, has now been appointed head coach of the leagues newest club: Greater Western Sydney.The challenge of bringing Aussie Rules into the heartland of Rugby League is enormous, but the AFL is determined to push ahead with the project and has backed Kevin Sheedy to lead the thrust into enemy territory. His recent signing of Rugby League superstar Israel Folau to Team GWS showed that he and the AFL are very serious about the Western Sydney venture.Kevin was born in Melbourne in 1947 and grew up in the inner suburbs. He began playing for Richmond at the age of 20 and played 251 games over 12 years before beginning a career as a coach. Between 1981 and 2007 he coached Essendon in 635 games.For Kevin, football is not only a sport but a medium for social change and improvement. He has devoted much of his life to indigenous coaching programs, spending a lot of time in northern Australia, and has become heavily involved in migrant assistance programs. He is determined to broaden AFL participation to as many areas of Australian society as possible, and is also keen to move the game into Pacific island nations and the west coast of America."1129,KRISTINA KENEALLY,1,,,19/09/2011,"The Hon Kristina Keneally MP is the Member for Heffron in the New South Wales Parliament.First elected in 2003, Kristina served as the 42nd Premier of New South Wales and the first woman Premier in the state from 2009 to 2011.  She has also had the privilege of serving the people of New South Wales as a Minister in the portfolios of Planning, Infrastructure, Disability Services, Ageing, World Youth Day and Redfern Waterloo.  In Government, Kristina oversaw the biggest expansion of disability services in the state's history through the historic partnership program Stronger Together.

With a career spanning almost 20 years, Magda is best known internationally for her role as Esme Hoggett in the film  and its sequel . Magda plays the fleshy foil, Sharon, to the whinging Kim in the popular TV sitcom, , now also screening in the UK and USA. She created the character of Sharon Strzelecki in the 1995 sketch show Big Girls Blouse, which she co-wrote, co-produced and starred in with her Kath & Kim co-stars Gina Riley and Jane Turner.Magda was born in Liverpool in England; her father was Polish and her mother Scottish. She moved to Australia with her family in 1966 and attended high school at Siena College, in Melbourne.Magda made the transition from university revue to television comedy in the ABC TVs , which fostered some of Australias most successful entertainment talents. In 1989 she shot to fame in the sketch comedy , which played for several years and become something of a national institution. Shes twice been named the Most Popular Person on Television (2003 and 2004) and has won seven Logies.More recently, Magda has been in the headlines again with her extraordinary weight loss- shedding 36kg last year in a public campaign with Jenny Craig.

Life as Afghanistan's most outspoken female MP is fraught with danger. In 2003, at 25, Malalai made worldwide news when she publicly denounced the Taliban and corrupt warlords who she claims have emerged to take control of the country with American backing. In 2005, she was elected to the Afghan parliament, but two years later was banished for her fierce criticisms of corrupt elements in the Afghan government.Since then, shes lived semi-underground, touring the world speaking against the Taliban, corruption and misogyny in Afghanistan.Often referred to as the bravest woman in Afghanistan she is a writer, feminist and anti-war activist . In 2010, she was named by  as one of the 100 Most Influential People of the World.Malalai was schooled as a refugee in Pakistan in the 1990s, in part at schools run by RAWA, the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan. She was a teacher in underground schools in Afghanistan during the Taliban era and in Farah province, her home, she set up free clinics and an orphanage.Malalai is opposed to all foreign troops in Afghanistan. She wants the U.S. and NATO troops to leave, immediately. They should leave, she says. The future civil war will not be more dangerous than the current civil war. She is bitterly opposed to the Taliban, but is equally opposed to those she calls gangsters who run the old Northern Alliance, and to President Karzai.Malalais recent tour of the United States was disrupted when the State Department refused to grant her a visa. The decision was reversed after worldwide protests. Her first visit to Australia was in 2009, with her autobiographical book . She returns this month and will appear at the Melbourne Writers Festival, promoting her new book, ."540,MALCOLM FRASER,0,,,24/05/2010,"Malcolm Frasers role in the 1975 dismissal of Gough Whitlams Labor government, and his subsequent accession to the prime ministership, was one of the most divisive events in Australian political history. Even today, several decades later, it is the subject of passionate argument.Ironically, however, public opinion of the man once reviled by the ALP and lionised by the Liberal Party has undergone a substantial shift over the years. Malcolms stances on such subjects as refugees, the republic, civil liberties and the Iraq war have earned him praise from the Left and drawn bitter acrimony from the Right. He long ago reconciled with Gough Whitlam, while in 2004 a Young Liberal convention demanded his party life membership be withdrawn.Malcolm was born in Toorak in 1930. He grew up in the Western Districts of Victoria and was educated at Melbourne Grammar and Oxford University. He entered Parliament in 1955 as MP for the Victorian seat of Wannon, which he would represent for 28 years. A back-bencher for 11 years, he served as Minister for the Army during the divisive years of the Vietnam War and as Minister for Education and science.Malcolm played a central role in Liberal Party leadership manoeuvrings during the early 1970s that ended with him taking over from Billy Snedden after the 1974 election loss. In 1975 he and his team used the Senate to delay Budget Bills and cause a deadlock over several months that resulted in the Governor-General, Sir John Kerr, dismissing the Whitlam government and installing Malcolm as caretaker Prime Minister. The coalition won the subsequent election in a landslide and won two more elections before Bob Hawke led Labor back to power in 1983.While in government Malcolm displayed many of the policy inclinations that would, in later years, cause a split with fellow Liberals. He rejected a push from within for radical conservative economic policies; he was a vocal critic of the apartheid regime in South Africa and pushed hard for the independence of Zimbabwe; and he supported multiculturalism and allowed more refugees  specifically boat people from Vietnam  to enter Australia.Since retiring from Parliament Malcolm has been active in many fields. He was a member of various eminent international bodies convened to assist development and independence in Africa during the 1980s, and represented Care Australia and Care International in senior positions from 1985 until 1999. He has worked on a wide range of boards and committees involved in international affairs and third world development over several decades, and has been granted a wide range of honours and honorary degrees.Malcolm has been married to Tamie for more than 50 years. They have four children and ten grandchildren. In his spare time Malcolms interests are photography, fishing, golf and vintage cars. He published his political memoirs earlier this year."540,MALCOLM FRASER,0,,,30/08/2010,"Malcolm Frasers role in the 1975 dismissal of Gough Whitlams Labor government, and his subsequent accession to the prime ministership, was one of the most divisive events in Australian political history.

They lived in a series of flats, mostly rented.Malcolm attended Vaucluse Public School and, with the aid of a scholarship, Sydney Grammar, to which in later life he donated a new scholarship program in his fathers name to help underprivileged students. After graduating from Sydney University with an arts-law degree, he won a Rhodes Scholarship and completed a further degree at Oxford.Malcolm worked as a journalist, lawyer and in business, and became widely known in the late 1990s for leading the Australian republican cause. He entered Parliament in 2004 and represents the seat of Wentworth which covers Sydneys Eastern Suburbs.Malcolm and his wife Lucy have two adult children and live in Point Piper in Sydney."1486,MANDY NOLAN,1,,,20/08/2012,"Mandy Nolan has performed as a stand-up comedian for 25 years. She was just 17 when she first found herself on stage, braving wild crowds as a beginner stand up. Nolan credits resilience and persistence in paving the way for a stand up comedy career that has not only endured it has had hard to impress comedic legends such as Austen Tayshus.Audiences adore Mandy on stage, and around Byron Bay where she lives, Mandy-jokes are as much a part of the vernacular as any surf speak.Her humour is sharp, honest, sometimes self-depreciating, somewhat outrageous, but never cruel or pretentious. Frequently irreverent, it speaks to a diverse audience with no set demographic, no gender, race or religion, occupation or tribe. It even crosses state borders and mediums (Mandy also writes and paints).Nolan is also in demand as a writer, last year scripting for David Bradburys anti-uranium mining film, . Nolan has been the editor of the Byron Shire Echos Entertainment Section  for over decade where she writes a weekly humorous editorial , a column which has become almost as iconic as the woman herself. Im like the big prawn she laughs. Colloquial, parochial but strangely imposing. Nolans writing has been noticed further afield as she has just become a regular featured columnist for the national publication .She has also appeared on SBSs  talking about the challenges facing women in their late 30s  40s and she also appeared several times on both series of SBSs often repeated . Its Nolans penchant for social observation and her knack of giving even the most challenging subject a comedic slant, that makes her a favoured MC at conference events in the Byron Shire and beyond."539,MARCIA LANGTON,1,,,24/05/2010,"Professor Marcia Langton is one of Australias best-known Indigenous advocates and scholars.Born in Queensland in 1951 and a descendant of the Yiman people, she travelled widely overseas before returning to Australia to work with several organisations dealing with social and cultural issues and land claims.

He was young, energetic, ambitious and had a brilliant mind for policy. But he was also known for not suffering fools gladly, and put many of his Labor Party colleagues offside by being openly contemptuous of those he regarded as lacking intelligence and policy nous.Mark was born in 1961 in Ashcroft, a suburb of south-western Sydney. He was educated at the selective Hurlstone Agricultural High School, where he was dux, and at the University of Sydney, where he graduated with a degree in economics. As a young man he worked as a research assistant to the former Labor Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, and worked on the latter's book .In 1987 he was elected to the City Council of Liverpool, in Sydney's south-west, and was mayor from 1991 to until entering Parliament in the western Sydney seat of Werriwa, Whitlams old seat. He was promoted to the shadow ministry as education spokesman after the 1998 election, but later quit following a policy dispute with the opposition leader, Kim Beazley. The two became political enemies following this incident.In December 2003 Mark, then aged 42, became the youngest federal Labor leader since its first leader Chris Watson, who became leader at age 33 in 1901. It was a bold move by the Labor caucus which ended the bitter rivalry between Beazley and Simon Crean, and for much of 2004 it appeared to be paying off as Labor under Latham looked fresher and more energetic than the coalition under John Howard. But the polls started turning against Labor after missteps on national security and the war in Iraq, and a disastrous policy on Tasmanian logging had the union movement in open warfare with the parliamentary party. With the coalition mounting a scare campaign based around Labor inexperience and an allegation that interest rates would rise under the ALP, Labor suffered a heavy defeat and Mark announced early in 2005 that he was resigning from the leadership and from Parliament.He devoted much of his time after Parliament to writing newspaper and magazine articles, and in his book  he mercilessly attacked many of his former colleagues and members of the press gallery.

The immediate past Chief of the Defence Force has become an instantly recognisable figure, widely admired for his leadership capabilities and his reputation as a straight talker.Peter was born in Sydney in 1947 and attended Waverley College in the Eastern Suburbs. At the age of 18, following in the footsteps of his Warrant Officer father, he joined the Army and enrolled at the Royal Military College, Duntroon. Subsequently he fought in Vietnam with the Royal Australian Regiment. He served with great distinction and received the Military Cross for gallantry in 1971.In 1999 Peter, who was then a Major General, led the successful international peace-keeping force in East Timor (INTERFET) overseeing the transition to independence. Peters leadership of the mission, carried out in adverse circumstances with significant military engagement, earned him a great deal of admiration and goodwill from the Australian public.In 2000 Peter was promoted to Lieutenant General and made Chief of the Army, before becoming a full General in 2002 when he took over as Chief of the Defence Force. He retired in 2005 and wrote his best-selling autobiography, My Story, but another episode of public service awaited him. In 2006 the Innisfail region of northern Queensland was devastated by Cyclone Larry, and Peter was asked to lead the reconstruction taskforce.In recognition of his efforts the Queensland Premier, Anna Bligh, announced in 2008 that a new residential suburb on Townsville would be named Cosgrove.Peter was made Australian of the Year in 2001.

He studied Law at Monash University and it was there, as a student leader, that he came to notice as a future politician. As a young lawyer he became famous for successfully taking on union oppression in the Dollar Sweets case in 1985, and in 1990 entered Parliament for the blue ribbon Melbourne seat of Higgins. He was promoted to senior shadow ministries during the early 90s and in 1994, following John Hewsons failed 'Fightback!' experiment, became deputy leader to Alexander Downer  an ill-fated combination that lasted until John Howard took over as leader in 1995.Peter became Treasurer after the 1996 coalition election victory and stayed there until Labor won again in 2007. He maintains his years in charge of the economy saw a combination of prosperity, growth and a return to surplus budgets after the fiscal disaster of Labors final term. But his years as Treasurer were also marked by growing frustration over Howards refusal to arrange an orderly leadership succession.

This quiet intelligent Jewish boy, who moved to Sydney at the age of one, should have grown up to become a dentist. Choosing that career would have pleased his mother Margaret and his father Isaac. Instead, he adopted an alter ego and became Australias most confronting stand-up comedian  Austen Tayshus.In contrast to his alter ego, Sandy is a highly-cultured and observant son of Judaism, a strict vegetarian who has beaten alcohol and drug abuse and is the father of two cherished daughters. At the age of 15 he participated in The International Bible Contest for Jewish Youth and met then Israeli President Zalman Shazar in Jerusalem.Sandy's father was a Holocaust survivor. A childhood obsession with his fathers wartime experience profoundly affected young Sandys relationship with the world, forging a personality destined to wage war against authority, racism, and institutional dogma. This weapon is Austen Tayshus - Merchant of Menace. His comic range is extraordinary and his fans include international film stars, world famous artists and a former Australian prime minister. Austen Tayshus has been performing for three decades, around Australia and around the world.His first single Australiana remains the biggest selling single in Australian recording history. He is a Tropfest winner, film school graduate, award winning recording artist and the most energetic and provocative satirist this country has ever seen.In July 2010 Sandy was endorsed as the Australian Sex Partys candidate for the federal seat of Warringah on Sydneys northern beaches (current sitting member Tony Abbott). In May this year, at the age of 57, he launched his own biography Austen Tayshus: Merchant of Menace. The book is written by Ross Fitzgerald and Rick Murphy."240,SARA HAGHDOOSTI,1,,,06/08/2009,"Sara is a 22 year old climate change activist.

Tom has just published  a three volume history of this country which has been widely acclaimed for its ability to humanise our history.Born in Sydney in 1935, Tom grew up in Kempsey, northern NSW. He attributes his verbal genes to those of his father, a great storyteller. His parents ensured he received a sound education from the Christian Brothers, who Tom says imbued him with a sense of social justice despite their generosity with the strap. After finishing school he took up theological studies for the Catholic priesthood. Tom abandoned this vocation in 1960 and turned to clerical work and teaching before publishing his first novel in 1964. Since that time he has been a full-time writer.On the international stage, Tom has been short-listed for the Booker Prize on 4 occasions: in 1972 for ,  in 1975, and  in 1979, before winning the prize in 1982 with .Here in Australia, Tom has won the Miles Franklin Award twice with  and . His short biography of Abraham Lincoln, signed by the author, was recently given to President Obama as a gift.. He holds a number of national and international honorary doctorates and is particularly proud of the one awarded by the National University of Ireland.Tom has made cameo appearances in a number of Australian films, the last being as a gate-keeper in The Final Winter. His offer to Spielberg to play a rabbi in  was politely rebuffed.Tom was awarded the Order of Australia in 1983 for his services to Australian Literature. He was the founding chairman of the Australian Republican Movement, and served on the Australian Constitutional Commission and the Australia-China Council.Tom lives in Sydney with his wife, Judy, and is Number 1 ticket-holder of the Manly-Warringah Rugby League team. He once made a television commercial for Rugby League which has ever since been considered the worst advertisement of its kind. He is confident his new book  is a bit better."618,TOM SWITZER,0,,,26/07/2010,"Tom Switzer is the editor of the Australian edition of  and is also attached to the US Studies Centre at Sydney University.A committed advocate for the conservative cause, he was senior adviser to former federal Liberal Party Leader Brendan Nelson until the 2008 leadership vote that saw Malcolm Turnbull take over in the top job.

Mr Rudd recently remarked of these school years that ""Wayne was very cool and I was very not.""In 1976 Wayne became a lecturer at the Queensland University of Technology, a position he would return to sporadically over the next decade until his political career developed. He spent some time in Canberra in the late 70s and early 80s, working for Bill Hayden, Kim Beazley and the late Mick Young. In the late 80s he became Campaign Director for the ALP and in this position oversaw the historic win by Labors Wayne Goss in the 1989 election that ended 32 continuous years in the wilderness for the ALP. In 1993, after serving as State Secretary and engineering another Goss victory, he entered Federal Parliament in the Brisbane seat of Lilley. Although he lost the seat in the 1996 Howard landslide Wayne returned in 1998 and moved to the Opposition front-bench. A renowned factional power-broker, he played an influential background role in various Labor leadership contests. He also established himself as a key member of the Labor team in senior shadow portfolios, becoming Shadow Treasurer in 2004. He maintained the portfolio after Labors 2007 victory and now has the task of overseeing Australias response to the global financial crisis.During the 1990s Wayne survived an attack of prostate cancer and is now a tireless advocate for early detection of the disease. He and his wife Kim live in Brisbane and have three children, Erinn, Libbi and Matt. Wayne says his objectives in public life are to create prosperity and thus spread opportunity."194,WENDY MACHIN,1,,,21/05/2009,"Wendy Machin is the President of NRMA Motoring Services.
