Initially these studies were undertaken with a view to entering the diplomatic corps, however circumstances changed and he subsequently pursued a vocational call instead. Archbishop MarkÌâåÕs study for the priesthood was undertaken at Corpus Christi CollegeÌâåÕs various campuses at Werribee, Glen Waverley and Clayton during the years 1969-74. He was ordained a priest in St. Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne on 18 May 1974 by Bishop John Kelly, then serving as Administrator of the diocese following the retirement of Cardinal James Knox.After Ordination, he worked as an assistant priest in various Melbourne parishes for a few years before studying Sacred Scripture at the Pontifical Biblical Institute. After four years in Rome and Jerusalem he returned to Melbourne to teach Scripture.Three years later he was again back in Rome for doctoral studies, after which he returned to teach in Melbourne and was eventually made the Master of Catholic Theological College.In late 1997 he was both greatly surprised and humbled to be invited to work in the Vatican Secretariat of State.Four years later he returned to Australia and was episcopally ordained Auxiliary Bishop for Melbourne.In 2004, he was appointed a member of the pontifical Council for Culture andChair of the Roman Missal Editorial Committee of the International Committee for English in the Liturgy. He was subsequently named Chair of the International Commission for the Preparation of an English-language Lectionary.In 2006, he was appointed as Archbishop of the Canberra and Goulburn Archdiocese upon the retirement of the long serving Archbishop Francis Carroll.In 2011, he was appointed a member of the Pontifical Council for Social Communications.On 2 April 2012, he was named Metropolitan Archbishop of Brisbane.Archbishop ColeridgeÌâåÕs move to the Brisbane Archdiocese has elevated him to the role of a Metropolitan - i.e. the head of a See with suffragan dioceses. Although all bishops are deemed to be on equal footing, the Metropolitan See of Brisbane makes Archbishop Coleridge the head of the province of Queensland (which also comprises the suffragan dioceses of Toowoomba, Rockhampton, Townsville and Cairns).In reflecting upon his four decades as a priest and a Bishop, Archbishop Coleridge has noted that almost nothing had turned out as he expected, but invariably events had turned out better than they would have had he planned them himself."0,MUSICIAN,,2012-10-29,ARCHIE ROACH,"Archie Roach is a singer and songwriter of remarkable strengths and insights. A storyteller in the tradition of his ancestors, Archie relays and retells intimate real life stories as well as traditional stories of the Dreaming. Archie was born at Framlingham Aboriginal mission, located near Warrnambool in south western Victoria. At any early age, Archie was taken from his family, part of the notorious ÌâåÔstolen generationÌâåÕ and spent quite some time in institutions before being fostered by a non-Indigenous family in Melbourne.He recorded his first record, , in 1990 with Paul Kelly as producer. The album contained , a song that dealt with Archie's personal experience. The album won two Aria Awards and a Human Rights Award - the first time a Human Rights award has been awarded to a songwriter. It was also in the 's Top 50 albums for 1992 and achieved gold status in Australia.Over the past few decades Archie has consistently and extensively toured Australia including participating in regional Indigenous cultural festivals in every state. As with many Indigenous artists, Archie has contributed to many benefit concerts and to raising awareness about issues of equality and justice that affect the whole community. Archie has toured with Paul Kelly, Weddings Parties Anything, Crowded House and international artists Bob Dylan, Billy Bragg, Tracy Chapman, Joan Armatrading, Suzanne Vega and Patti Smith.ArchieÌâåÕs great love Ruby Hunter died too young in early 2010. In October of that year Archie suffered a stroke while holding music classes with children at remote Turkey Creek in the Kimberley. He was unable to walk and his whole right side was buggered including his guitar strumming hand. Through rehabilitation and practice, he was able to walk and play the guitar once again. Then doctors discovered Archie had the very early stages of lung cancer. He opted for surgery and had half a lung removed.His new album,  is a triumphant and also courageous return. This is a man who lost everything then lost some more but he has been bold enough to come back to the stage and the spotlight and tell us what he has learned."0,POLITICIAN,LIBERAL,2013-07-22,ARTHUR SINODINOS,"NSW Liberal Senator Arthur Sinodinos, the Assistant Treasurer, is a ministerial newcomer but an old hand at politics as a key staff member for former Prime Minister John Howard.He first worked for Mr Howard as Senior Economic Adviser from 1987-89, resuming that role when Mr Howard returned to the Opposition leadership in 1995. In 1997 Arthur became Mr HowardÌâåÕs Chief of Staff, a position he held for nine years.

Three years later, he and Melinda created the Gates Library Foundation, which worked to bring public access computers with Internet connections to libraries in the United States.

He won in a landslide. He went on to form KatterÌâåÕs Australian Party in 2011, an independent grouping with a wide-ranging policy manifesto that includes the right to hunt, fish and boil a billy. Before entering Federal Parliament Bob was a Queensland State MP and held four ministerial positions.

He is also one of the most acerbic, renowned for his withering scorn. He once described Princess Diana as 'a simpering Bambi narcissistÌâåÕ, and Mother Teresa as a ÌâåÔthieving, fanatical Albanian dwarf.'An author, journalist, literary critic and political observer, Christopher is much sought-after as a lecturer and television commentator in the United States, where he now lives, and his native United Kingdom. Once a Trotskyist, his dissatisfaction with the Left began in 1989 when a fatwa ÌâåÐ an Islamic death sentence - was placed on his friend, author Salman Rushdie, by the Ayatollah Khomeini. The terror attacks of September 11, 2001 strengthened his opposition to Islamofascism and he became a vocal supporter of the Iraq war and the overthrow of Saddam Hussein.But Christopher rejects labels such us neoconservative (""IÌâåÕm not any kind of conservative"") and is usually described as a radical who opposes any kind of totalitarianism and stands for individual liberty.As an author, editor and journalist ChristopherÌâåÕs output is prodigious. His most recent book, 2007ÌâåÕs , is a fierce denunciation of organised religion: 'violent, irrational, intolerant, allied to racism, tribalism, invested in ignorance and hostile to free inquiry, contemptuous of women and coercive toward children.'Christopher was born in Portsmouth, England in 1949 and attended Oxford University.

Her mother, Norma Chevathun, was a prominent indigenous leader in the 1980s and 90s and one of the original Wik native title claimants.GinaÌâåÕs parents instilled in her the importance of both a strong sense of her identity as an Aboriginal person and the need to succeed in mainstream society.  As a result, Gina moves easily between two very different worlds.Gina is managing director of Wik Projects Ltd, an organisation set up by Wik and Wik Waya traditional owners to articulate their aspirations, represent their interests and pursue sustainable economic development opportunities on their country ÌâåÐ opportunities which provide better socio-economic outcomes for Aboriginal people and reflect cultural and environmental values important to traditional owners.Wik Projects currently supports two local indigenous businesses that operate for the benefit of the communities of the western Cape, Aurukun Wetland Charters (an eco-tourism businesses operating on the Aurukun wetlands) and Aurukun Earthmoving (which provides contract earthmoving mainly to Rio TintoÌâåÕs bauxite mine and to QueenslandÌâåÕs Main Roads department). Wik Projects is also developing a proposal to harvest timber from the bauxite mining lease areas north of Aurukun ÌâåÐ reducing carbon emissions by using a resource which would otherwise be bulldozed and burnt, and enabling traditional owners to be actively engaged in the rehabilitation of their country after mining is finished.Gina believes that everyone should have the opportunity to realise their aspirations and that this principle should apply as much to Aboriginal people as anyone else.  For decades, the lives of Aboriginal people in Aurukun were controlled first by missionaries and then by government.  For Gina, building an economic base will only happen if Aboriginal people and their organisations are empowered and supported, at the local level, to build it."0,AUTHOR,,2012-05-21,GLENN CARLE,"Glenn Carle is a CIA interrogator turned writer.

This period, referred to as ChinaÌâåÕs lost decade, had a profound impact on Guo Jian and his contemporaries. The Chinese people were subjected to intense and relentless political indoctrination. There was a climate of mistrust, violence and betrayal, and the country was culturally remade as ancient traditions, society and beliefs were abandoned or destroyed. News was disseminated by loudspeakers and political posters.Guo JianÌâåÕs art belongs to the school of Cynical Realism, which began in the 1990s in Beijing. His art is heavily influenced by the last 50 years of upheaval and violence in China. Cynical Realism is essentially a response to propaganda-laden Socialist Realism, and uses the artistic style of propaganda posters (Guo Jian was a poster painter during his time in the PeopleÌâåÕs Liberation Army from 1979 to 1982) in a subtly subversive manner to question authority and totalitarianism. Following the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, in which he participated, and the subsequent crackdown by the Chinese authorities, Guo Jian emigrated to Australia. He arrived in Sydney, working as a labourer by day and painting by night. His work was well received and his reputation grew.He returned to China in 2005 and now lives in an art colony near Beijing.

Her fascination with animal behaviour began in early childhood. In her leisure time, she observed native birds and animals, making extensive notes and sketches, and read widely in the literature of zoology and ethology. From an early age, she dreamed of travelling to Africa to observe exotic animals in their natural habitats.Jane attended the Uplands private school, receiving her school certificate in 1950 and a higher certificate in 1952. At age 18 she left school and found employment as a secretary at Oxford University. In her spare time, she worked at a London-based documentary film company to finance a long-anticipated trip to Africa.In July 1960, at the age of 26, Jane travelled from England to what is today Tanzania and bravely entered the little-known world of wild chimpanzees. She was equipped with nothing more than a notebook and a pair of binoculars. Jane's fieldwork led to the publication of numerous articles and five major books. She was known and respected first in scientific circles and, through the media, became a celebrity. , her first major text, appeared in 1971. The book, essentially a field study of chimpanzees, effectively bridged the gap between scientific treatise and popular entertainment. Her vivid prose brought the chimps to life, although her tendency to attribute human behaviours and names to chimpanzees struck some critics being as manipulative. Jane's efforts to educate people about the ethical treatment of animals extends to young children as well. Her 1989 book, , was written specifically for children, to convey a new, more humane view of wildlife. The book received the 1989 Unicef/Unesco Children's Book-of-the-Year Award, and Jane used the prize money to have the text translated into Swahili.In recognition of her achievements, Jane has received numerous honours and awards, including the Gold Medal of Conservation from the San Diego Zoological Society in 1974, the J. Paul Getty Wildlife Conservation Prize in 1984, the Schweitzer Medal of the Animal Welfare Institute in 1987, the National Geographic Society Centennial Award in 1988, and the Kyoto Prize in Basic Sciences in 1990. More recently, she was named a Messenger of Peace by the United Nations in 2002 and a Dame of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II of England in 2003.Today, the Jane Goodall Institute works to protect the famous chimpanzees of Gombe National Park in Tanzania. Likewise, Jane GoodallÌâåÕs Roots & Shoots, which Jane started with a group of Tanzania students in 1991, is today the InstituteÌâåÕs global environmental and humanitarian youth program for young people from preschool through university with nearly 150,000 members in more than 130 countries. Jane is determined to use just about every minute she has working to save chimpanzees and to empower people ÌâåÐ young and old ÌâåÐ to do what they can for a better world."1,JOURNALIST,,2009-10-08,JANET ALBRECHTSEN,"Janet Albrechtsen is a writer and commentator for .

He is AustraliaÌâåÕs second-longest serving Prime Minister, having served in the office from March 1996 to December 2007 ÌâåÐ an 11-year stretch bettered only by the cumulative 18 years achieved by his political hero, Sir Robert Menzies.John was born in 1938 and grew up in the Sydney suburb of Earlwood. He became politically active in the Liberal Party as a teenager, becoming a committed party operator and campaigner and, in 1967, a (failed) State candidate. He entered Federal Parliament for the Sydney seat of Bennelong in 1974, and was appointed Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs after the coalition, led by Malcolm Fraser, beat the Whitlam Labor government in the Dismissal election of 1975.In 1977 he was made Treasurer at the extremely young age of 38. He was an advocate of free-market economics and championed a range of reforms and policies which were frequently resisted by the Fraser cabinet. After Bob Hawke led Labor back to government in 1983 John was involved in a long-running leadership stoush with the more experienced Andrew Peacock. He defeated Peacock in a 1985 ballot and was defeated himself by Peacock in 1989 having lost the 1987 election.At a press conference on the night of his defeat he was asked whether he would consider the leadership again, and suggested that would be like ÌâåÔLazarus with a triple by-pass.ÌâåÕ Hence the title of his memoirs, . Many observers thought a come-back was beyond him as the Liberals experimented, and failed, with such leadership options as John Hewson and Alexander Downer. But in January 1995, with the party in a poor state and thought to be facing defeat, he took over from Downer and set about restoring the Liberal brand as Labor, under Paul Keating, lost its way. The election in 1996 was a landslide victory for the coalition.In government the Howard years had many key points, including the severe early spending cuts to restore the budget surplus, the GST, the Iraq war and the adoption of tough industrial relations legislation. The Howard government was widely seen as confrontational and ideological, and its relations with several communities ÌâåÐ indigenous Australians, environmentalists, asylum seekers ÌâåÐ were often strained. Just before the 2001 election the Government used the military to turn away the Tampa, a container vessel which had picked up a load of stricken asylum seekers, and set the tone for a debate over refugees that continues to this day.By 2007 the Howard government was being weakened on many fronts. It had refused to apologise to the ÌâåÔstolen generationÌâåÕ and to ratify the Kyoto protocol on global warming, both of which had great symbolic value. Treasurer Peter Costello was openly seeking the leadership and many Australians were unhappy with WorkChoices, the GovernmentÌâåÕs revamped industrial relations legislation. Kevin Rudd led Labor to victory and former ABC presenter Maxine McKew defeated John in his own seat.Since then John has made only limited forays into public debate, though he was a prominent supporter of his protÌÄå©gÌÄå©, Tony Abbott, in this yearÌâåÕs election. He has spent a lot of time on the international conservative speaking circuit and preparing his memoirs. John has been married to Janette since 1971 and they have three adult children, Melanie, Tim and Richard."0,ACADEMIC,,2010-08-30,JOHN KEANE,"John Keane is Professor of Politics at the University of Sydney.

These began with a trilogy made up of the bestseller ; the polemic philosophical dictionary ; and the book that grew out of his presentation of the Massey Lectures, .In 2005 in The Collapse of Globalism and the Reinvention of the World, Saul warned that, like it or not, globalism was already collapsing and that if we did not act quickly we would be caught in a crisis and limited to emergency reactions. The Collapse of Globalism was re-issued in 2009 with an updated epilogue that addresses the current crisis.In his most recent national bestseller, , Saul argues that Canada's complex national identity is made up of the ""triangular reality"" of the three nations that compose it: Anglophones, Francophones, and the First Peoples. He emphasizes the willingness of these Canadian nations to compromise with one another, as opposed to resorting to open confrontations.A long-time champion of freedom of expression, in 2009 John was elected President of International PEN, the worldwide association of writers.

He is founder and Chair of lending giant Aussie Home Loans, the company which has made him one of the nation's richest men, with an estimated fortune of $365 million. In 1987, after surviving severe personal and financial crises, John set about realising his dream of owning a home loan company. With the help of $10,000 from a relative , he created Aussie Home Loans and opened for business in 1992. The company was unique in its approach to home loans, offering 24 hours a day service and much cheaper loans than those offered by banks. John's revolutionary approach finally forced the banks to lower interest rates and fees and made homeownership a possibility for a generation of Australians formerly excluded from the market. The company rapidly grew as consumers became aware of Aussie Home Loans and banks were forced to copy JohnÌâåÕs strategies as their market share diminished. In 2002, John re-invented the company as a mortgage broker selling its own products and low rate credit card. John was born in 1947 in rural NSW and spent his childhood in both Sydney and Brisbane.

This early education would prove useful as the future director began his career giving puppet shows for children's birthday parties. As a teenager, John began making 8-mm underground movies influenced by the likes of Jean-Luc Godard, Walt Disney, Andy Warhol, Russ Meyer, Ingmar Bergman, and Herschell Gordon Lewis.Using Baltimore, which he fondly dubbed the ""Hairdo Capitol of the World,"" as the setting for all his films, John assembled a cast of ensemble players, mostly native Baltimoreans and friends of long standing: Divine, David Lochary, Mary Vivian Pearce, Mink Stole and Edith Massey. John also established lasting relationships with key production people, such as production designer Vincent Peranio, costume designer Van Smith, and casting director Pat Moran, helping to give his films that trademark Waters ""look.""John made his first film, an 8-mm short,  in 1964, starring Mary Vivian Pearce. He followed with  in 1966, the first of his films to star Divine and Mink Stole. In 1967, he made his first 16-mm film with , the story of a deranged governess and her lover who kidnap fashion models and force them to model themselves to death. Mondo Trasho, John's first feature length film, was completed in 1969 despite the fact that the production ground to a halt when the director and two actors were arrested for ""participating in a misdemeanor, to wit: indecent exposure.""In 1970, he completed what he described as his first ""celluloid atrocity,"" . The film told the story of Lady Divine and her lover, Mr. David, proprietors of a freak show who lure unsuspecting suburbanites into their tents to witness ""The Cavalcade of Perversions."" In 1972 John created what would become the most ""notorious"" film in the American independent cinema of the 1970's, . The film turned John into a cult celebrity and went on to become a smash success at midnight screenings in the U.S. and all over the world. When the film was rereleased in 1997 John proudly boasted, ""it's hard to offend three generations, but it looks like I've succeeded.""John followed the success of  with three more pictures, spanning the remainder of the decade:  and , which was filmed in ""Odorama."" Ticket buyers were given scratch 'n' sniff cards that allowed the audience to smell along with the characters in their fragrant search for romantic happiness.In , John created ""an almost big-budget comedy extravaganza about star-struck teenage celebrities in 1962. The success of  brought John major Hollywood backing for his next feature, , a juvenile delinquent musical comedy satire, starring Johnny Depp. In 1994, John released , the well reviewed, socially un-redeeming comedy starring Kathleen Turner and Sam Waterston, which was the closing night attraction at that year's Cannes Film Festival.John then directed , a feel-good movie about lesbian strippers, pubic-hair harassment and amateur photography; , a comedy action-thriller about a young lunatic film director (Stephen Dorff) and his gang of film cultists who kidnap a real-life Hollywood movie goddess (Melanie Griffith) and force her to act in their own Super 8 underground movie; and , a film about head injury sufferers who, after their concussion, experience a carnal lust they cannot control. In addition to writing and directing feature films, John is the author of six books, he is a photographer and an actor.He is currently in Australia touring . Described as a vaudeville act,  celebrates the film career and obsessive tastes of the man William Burroughs once called ÌâåÒThe Pope of TrashÌâåÓ. Focusing on WatersÌâåÕ early artistic influences, his fascination with true crime, exploitation films, fashion lunacy, and the extremes of the contemporary art world, this joyously devious monologue elevates all that is trashy in life into a call to arms to filth followers everywhere."0,AUTHOR,,2011-10-03,JON RONSON,"Jon Ronson is a writer and television presenter.

Her upbringing was a very typical conservative catholic country one. She knew from about the age of 3-4 that she wanted to be a girl, but loved tonka trucks and tractors like most little boys. JuliaÌâåÕs definition of confusion for an 8 year old is playing with Tonkas and wanting to wear her sister's dress.Julia threw herself into blokey stuff like cars and motor bikes as a teen, never sport, and loved the farm. Her parents had a stone fruit orchard, peaches, cherries and strawberries in Bathurst NSW. She fought and denied her true feelings but also cross dressed regularly. By her early adult years, Julia convinced herself it was just a phase and that she would meet and marry Miss Right and live happily ever after. It didn't happen, and the older she got the stronger the feelings and desire to be a woman became. At the age of 26, Julia began considering transition after a relationship breakdown, but started to see a psychiatrist with a view to be ÌâåÒcuredÌâåÓ of the desire to be a woman. Julia begged to be given medication, and received male hormones from her GP, saw hypnotists and sex therapists over the course of ten years.Finally at 36 and discounting suicide as the answer ÌâåÐ Julia began to transition. Life became wonderful, there was a sense of relief when she finally took the first dose of female hormones. Her doctors were supportive and helpful. Julia got a job in Sydney driving buses for the state government where she worked for 18 months before she transitioned. 8 months later she was sacked- she believes for being transgender- and is still fighting the NSW Government for compensation. In 2001, Julia took part in Ruth CullenÌâåÕs documentary , the film that documented her transition from Paul to Julia.  premiered at the State Theatre as part of the Sydney International Film Festival in 2003 where she and the film received a standing ovation from a packed house. It screened twice on SBS however the best screening was at the local cinema in Bathurst. Today Julia is unemployed.

When Kevin came to office he moved quickly to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, formally apologise to indigenous Australians for the Stolen Generations, signal the end of combat operations by Australian troops in Iraq and appoint a woman as AustraliaÌâåÕs next Governor-General. But throughout 2009 the overwhelming issue was the global financial crisis and AustraliaÌâåÕs response to it. Also occupying the GovernmentÌâåÕs mind was how to respond to global warming, the continuing war in Afghanistan, a new wave of boat people and problems in the relationship with economic giants China and India. While all this was happening the domestic political conflict continued unabated.

She was just 17 when she first found herself on stage, braving wild crowds as a beginner stand up. Nolan credits resilience and persistence in paving the way for a stand up comedy career that has not only endured it has had hard to impress comedic legends such as Austen Tayshus.Audiences adore Mandy on stage, and around Byron Bay where she lives, Mandy-jokes are as much a part of the vernacular as any surf speak.Her humour is sharp, honest, sometimes self-depreciating, somewhat outrageous, but never cruel or pretentious. Frequently irreverent, it speaks to a diverse audience with no set demographic, no gender, race or religion, occupation or tribe. It even crosses state borders and mediums (Mandy also writes and paints).Nolan is also in demand as a writer, last year scripting for David BradburyÌâåÕs anti-uranium mining film, . Nolan has been the editor of the Byron Shire EchoÌâåÕs Entertainment Section  for over decade where she writes a weekly humorous editorial , a column which has become almost as iconic as the woman herself.

He has also become known as an articulate and effective parliamentary advocate for contemporary Australian conservatism.Nick, who features in the documentary , shocked his colleagues in 2010 by resigning from the Opposition front bench and announcing he would quit politics when his Senate term expired. It was, he said, a decision prompted by a serious accident to his son Oliver, an Australian Defence Force cadet, which caused him to reassess the priorities in his life. At that time Nick was Opposition Senate Leader, communications spokesman and a key member of the coalitionÌâåÕs strategy team. He is now a private citizen but one with a keen interest in conservative politics.Born in Sydney in 1953, he graduated in Economics and Law from the Australian National University before joining the Liberal Party Federal Secretariat in Canberra in 1977, becoming Deputy Federal Director in 1983. He moved to Adelaide and in 1985 became SA State Director, a position he held until he entered the Senate in 1993.When the coalition won government in 1996 he became a parliamentary secretary and was promoted to the full ministry the next year. In 2001 he became Minister for Finance, a key portfolio which he held until Labor won office in 2007. He was also Leader of the Government in the Senate for the coalitionÌâåÕs last two years in office.Nick has strong views on a range of issues, and is known as a committed supporter of voluntary voting, the monarchy, privatisation, StatesÌâåÕ rights and industrial relations reform.

Other strong areas of interest include aged care, climate change, fuel pricing, housing affordability and the Murray-Darling Basin.Nick has a reputation for being a true Independent and a tough negotiator in the horse-trading that takes place in the Senate over legislation when no one party has a majority. After being re-elected in the recent election Nick will form part of the large group of Greens, Independents and micro-party Senators with which the major parties will have to negotiate to get the numbers to pass, or block, particular items of legislation.Nick attended Prince Alfred College in Adelaide and studied law at the University of Adelaide, attaining his Bachelor of Laws in 1981. He established and became principal of his own law firm, Xenophon & Co, in 1984.

She is particularly passionate about fostering decentralisation, supporting farmers, home-grown food security and balancing water for agriculture and environment, as well as improving services for rural health.After being elected for a fifth term in September 2013, Sussan was made Assistant Minister for Education, with specific responsibility for childcare, early childhood education and vocational education training in schools."1,OTHER,,2010-08-12,SUVENDRINI PERERA,Dr Suvendrini Perera is associate professor of cultural studies at Curtin University.1,SCIENTIST,,2014-09-15,SUZANNE CORY,"Professor Suzanne Cory is one of Australia's most distinguished molecular biologists.

Tom has just published  a three volume history of this country which has been widely acclaimed for its ability to humanise our history.Born in Sydney in 1935, Tom grew up in Kempsey, northern NSW. He attributes his verbal genes to those of his father, a great storyteller. His parents ensured he received a sound education from the Christian Brothers, who Tom says imbued him with a sense of social justice despite their generosity with the strap.

Tom abandoned this vocation in 1960 and turned to clerical work and teaching before publishing his first novel in 1964. Since that time he has been a full-time writer.On the international stage, Tom has been short-listed for the Booker Prize on 4 occasions: in 1972 for ,  in 1975, and  in 1979, before winning the prize in 1982 with .Here in Australia, Tom has won the Miles Franklin Award twice with  and . His short biography of Abraham Lincoln, signed by the author, was recently given to President Obama as a gift.. He holds a number of national and international honorary doctorates and is particularly proud of the one awarded by the National University of Ireland.Tom has made cameo appearances in a number of Australian films, the last being as a gate-keeper in The Final Winter. His offer to Spielberg to play a rabbi in  was politely rebuffed.Tom was awarded the Order of Australia in 1983 for his services to Australian Literature. He was the founding chairman of the Australian Republican Movement, and served on the Australian Constitutional Commission and the Australia-China Council.Tom lives in Sydney with his wife, Judy, and is Number 1 ticket-holder of the Manly-Warringah Rugby League team.
